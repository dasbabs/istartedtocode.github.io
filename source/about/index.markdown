Hello World!
My name is Babs and I wanna be a coder, a Ruby on Rails coder for starters. 

I am going to write about my progress and want to share my experience while learning. One of the first things to get familiar with Rails on www.rubyonrails.org is the Getting Started Guide where you learn how to make a blog in Rails. Following the guide I made a blog and tried to improve it while I'm learning all the things necessary to code in Rails.

After a while I found out that the things I wanna post about need a lot of coding-snippets and I couldn't find a decent way to implement them in my blog which used forms to enter text. I read about Octopress often but after a vienna.rb meeting in Vienna and a presentation of making a blog like this I decided to go for it and changed the blog to one powered by Octopress.

Please note that English is not my first language. If you recognize any mistakes or have any questions please contact me. I am currently using the following email-address istartedtocode [at] gmail [dot ]com but plan to add a contact form as soon as I am able to handle it with Rails.
